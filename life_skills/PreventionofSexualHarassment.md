**WWhat would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?**


1.Assess your safety: Prioritize your safety and well-being. If you feel threatened or in immediate danger, remove yourself from the situation and seek a safe space.

2.Document the incidents: Keep a record of the incidents, including dates, times, locations, descriptions of the behavior, and any relevant details. This documentation can serve as evidence if you decide to report the harassment later.

3.Talk to someone you trust: Reach out to a trusted friend, colleague, supervisor, or human resources department and share your experience. Discussing the situation with someone supportive can provide emotional support and help you gather more perspectives on how to address the issue.

4.Review your organization's policies: Familiarize yourself with your organization's policies and procedures regarding sexual harassment. Understand the reporting mechanisms available to you and the steps involved in filing a complaint.

5.Report the incidents: If you feel comfortable doing so, report the incidents to the appropriate authority within your organization, such as your supervisor, human resources department, or designated harassment officer. Follow the established reporting procedures and provide them with the documented evidence if available.

6.Seek legal advice if necessary: In some cases, you may need to consult with an attorney or legal professional who specializes in employment law or sexual harassment cases. They can provide guidance on your rights, legal options, and potential courses of action.

7.Support resources: Seek support from local organizations, helplines, or counseling services that specialize in assisting victims of sexual harassment. They can offer guidance, resources, and emotional support during this challenging time.
