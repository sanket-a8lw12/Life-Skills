## According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?
Listening is following the thoughts and feelings of another and understanding what the other is
saying from his or her perspective. Reflective listening is a special type of listening that involves
paying respectful attention to the content and feeling expressed in another persons 
communication. Reflective listening is hearing and understanding, and then letting the other
know that he or she is being heard and understood. It requires responding actively to another
while keeping your attention focused completely on the speaker. In reflective listening, you do
not offer your perspective by carefully keep the focus on the other’s need or problem. Thus
reflective listening consists of a step beyond what is normally thought of as listening:
* Responding to the other person by reflecting the thoughts and feelings you heard in his or
her words, tone of voice, body posture, and gestures.
* Hearing and understanding what the other person is communicating through words and
body language to the best of your ability.

## What are the obstacles in your listening process?
* When I am in conversation with someone at that time some irrelevant ideas come in my mind so that i get destructed.
* I am not able to maintain the concentration on that topic for long time, When speaker takes more time then i started losing interest on that topic.
* Talking with friends in between the conversation that is also obstacles of active listening.

## What can you do to improve your listening?

For more interaction ask some question from speaker if he is interested for
reply some point that you are not able to understand.
