## 1. What are the activities you do that make you relax - Calm quadrant?

There are several activities that help me relax and feel calm. Engaging in activities that involve muscle memory, such as playing badminton or table tennis, is one of them. I also find learning Spanish to be calming when I'm sitting down. Taking a peaceful walk in a garden or forest is refreshing and soothing for me.

I find serenity in gardening and watching plants grow. Listening to music and meditating are also helpful in promoting relaxation. Finally, on a stressful day, taking naps is a calming way for me to recharge.

I experience stress when I get into conflicts with others. It is also particularly stressful for me when I'm close to missing a work deadline.

Feeling overwhelmed and when things don't go according to plan, it can be a source of stress and give me a headache.

I also find it stressful when people close to me are suffering from serious illnesses or health issues.

The feeling of getting butterflies in my stomach is a pretty good indicator of my mind being in the Excitement quadrant. It happens when I go on dates or when I know I'm going to get a promotion or if I'm going on a vacation.

Expectation of happiness is a tell-tale sign of being excited.

The speaker then moves on to how sleep depravation reduces the performance of your brain by 40%, in a data collected from two group in which one was sleep deprived and the other has seven and a half hours of sleep. There is also a reduction in brain activity in the individuals who got sufficient amount of sleep.

Matt mentions how during sleep there a sudden burst of electrical signals, called sleep-spindles, which is pathway to a more permanent long-term storage, just like how memory is offloaded from a RAM to a ROM, when user exits an application.

Aging is one of the important factors that contributes to memory declines, but  sleep deprivation is another factor that largely get ignored.

Matt's Sleep center is not to optimistic about sleeping pills. His center uses another method of giving electric shock with unnoticeable amount of voltage that we can't feel.

Matt then associates how day-light savings time in US at spring time affects individuals, where there is a 24% increase in heart related hospitalizations, due to reduction in sleeping time and a 24% decrease during summer, when people get adequate amount of sleep. He also talks about there being a correlation between day-light savings time and car accidents which are majorly caused because of lack of sleep.

Getting just 4 hours of sleep a day, there is a 70% decrease in the number of natural killer cells in your body. He then links this to how it is reponsible for various cancers. WHO has called a night shift work a probable carcinogen, because of the said reasons.

Matt lists tips for better sleep; `regularity` (go to bed at same time and wake up at the same time), `being in cool environment` (it allows our body to sleep better when we experience a reduction in surround temperature by 2 degree Celcius.)

Here our permanent memories are stored.

She then talks about her being sedentary during her time in research, how she felt unhappy and unsatisfied, while also gainig 50 pounds. It was when she went on excursion and outing that she lost 50 pounds. It was then that she enjoyed doing her work even more. It was like she was doing research on other people, but she was also the subject of her research all along.
